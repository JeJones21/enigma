# enigma

## Functionality   
**MEETS EXPECTATIONS**
I did not make it to the final *Cracking* method. Therefore I did not exceed expectations. I do have all other required methods executed.


## OOP
**MEETS EXPECTATIONS**
I was tempted to mark exceeds because I did include 1 module, but my code is not 100% *DRY*. I broke my code down into an extra KEY class and OFFSET class, but ran into complications when it came time to tie it all together in the Enigma class with Encryption and Decryption... This resulted in me having to repeat a few methods in the Enigma class. I will refactor this in the future but ran out of time before the deadline. Working is better than not working.


## Ruby Convention
**MEETS EXPECTATIONS**
My code is properly indented and spaced. But I do not exceed because 2 methods are 11 lines long instead of the 10 max. I also left some comments in my code so I can refer back when I study this project and for when the time comes to refactor.


## TDD
**EXCEEDS EXPECTATIONS**
I have successfully implemented several stubs. SimpleCov currently sits at 100%. Tests for multiple edge cases include Uppercase characters and expectations for cases in which there is not a date or key provided.

## Version Control
**EXCEEDS EXPECTATIONS**
I have 4 pull requests and 91 commits for this project.

## Summary
It took me a few days to wrap my brain around this project. I would like to do it again once I have gained more knowledge and experience.
